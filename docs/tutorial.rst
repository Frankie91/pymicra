Calculating auxiliary variables and units
-----------------------------------------

Pymicra has some handy functions that convert between units using Pint.

Extracting fluxes
-----------------

Although you can extract the fluxes manually either using the DataFrame or extracting
the Numpy arrays, Pymicra has a couple of functions that come in handy.


Obtaining the spectra
---------------------

Using Numpy's fast Fourier transform implementation, Pymicra is also able to extract
spectra, co-spectra and quadratures.
