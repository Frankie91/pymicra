Installation
============

.. warning::
    The commands written here assume you are running a Ubuntu-based distribution of 
    Linux. Although the basic steps should be similar for all Linux distributions, you 
    should adapt the specific commands to your system in case you are using any other OS.

.. include:: global.rst

Pymicra should work with both Python 2.7 and Python 3. Most of the required
packages already come with python, such as ``datetime`` or ``os``. The packages
that may not come as default are:

-  Pandas_
-  Pint_
-  Numpy_
-  Scipy_
-  setuptools (for installation only)

As of December 2017, Pymicra is hosted on PyPi and can be installed with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymicra

If any problem occurs, please contact me through email or creating a `Github
issue`_ detailing your problem and I will try to improve the setup file
accordingly.
