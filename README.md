## Main Features
A small list of things this package is designed to do:

  - Automatically read and understand micrometeorological data in virtually any column-separated ASCII format (thanks to pandas).
  - Interpolate and detrend data in the most common ways (block averages, moving averages and linear detrending).
  - Automatically rotate the coordinates given wind data, so that the v and w averages are null.
  - Calculate fluxes
